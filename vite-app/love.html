          <h3>How we met</h3>
          <p>I never expected anything special that day. I went back to my old school as a guest speaker, spoke my heart out, and when it was over, I was just… waiting. My car was late, so I stood there casually talking to the receptionist, thinking nothing of it.</p>
          <p>And then she walked in.</p>
          <p>She came to get some work done, and somehow—without me even realizing it—that moment changed everything. Later, I found out she came back to the reception more than once, even though her work was already finished. She says she “just happened to be there,” but I know better now.</p>
          <p>She found my Instagram, quietly stalked it, gathered the courage to text me… and somehow that one message turned into us. Funny how the most important people enter your life when you’re not even looking.</p>

          <h3>First date</h3>
          <p>Our first date felt like a secret only the universe knew about.</p>
          <p>I picked her up quietly from her house, hearts racing, and the first stop was KFC—simple, cozy, and perfect. Two burgers, fries, chicken popcorn… and a lip gloss I’d picked out just for her from Miniso. When she put it on, she missed a little, and in that moment I swear time slowed down. I leaned in, wiped it off gently, pretending it was nothing—while my heart was screaming.</p>
          <p>Then I took her to one of my favorite hilly spots. She didn’t want to step into the bushes—spiders terrified her—so I picked her up and made her sit safely. She laughed, and that laugh stayed with me.</p>
          <p>She wanted to kiss me, and I—being the absolute idiot I am—played dumb for thirty whole minutes. Thirty. Minutes. When it finally clicked and we kissed, it felt unreal. We made out, left… and then realized we weren’t done yet. So I turned the car around, went back, and we kissed again—like neither of us wanted the moment to end.</p>
          <p>And honestly? Neither of us ever did.</p>

          <h3>Favorite memory</h3>
          <p>After three dates, after all the laughter, teasing, stolen glances, and growing feelings, I dropped her back home. The moment felt heavy in the best way—like something important was about to happen.</p>
          <p>I wanted to ask her to be my girlfriend. Instead, without thinking, I asked, “Will you marry me?”</p>
          <p>For a second, there was silence—then we both burst out laughing. Pure, uncontrollable laughter. No pressure. No fear. Just joy.</p>
          <p>And somehow, in that laughter, everything felt clear. That was the moment I knew—whatever this was, it was real, and it was ours.</p>
